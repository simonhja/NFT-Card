### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned
- Vertical Align (used for positioning the eth and clock icons)
- "Position: relative" & "Position: absolute" (used to put the eye icon over the main image when hovering)
- A tiny bit about BEM (alltough I ended up not using it this time)
- Flex Justify Content: space-between

### Struggles
- Image overlay
    - Positioning (how to get it on top of the image and center it)
    - Where to put it in the html
    - Extra space under the image when hovering (img container is slighly bigger than the image and I wasn't able to figure out why)
- How to center the Eth and clock icon vertically
- Class naming & CSS targeting (use class or ID?)
